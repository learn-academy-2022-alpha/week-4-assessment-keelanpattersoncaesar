# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props stand for properties. They are used to pass values from parent components to child components.

  Researched answer: Props (properties) are used to pass arguments into React components. Parent => Child. Props are READ ONLY and can only be passed one way. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is anything the user does while on your React page. It could be hovering a button, changing the page to dark mode, or anything really. Those DOM events change the state of the page. They are constantly updated. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event allows developers to code different triggers when the end user performs an action. This can be used to make webpages extremely fluid and interactive. Basically, when a user performs an action, JS code is executed.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a programming that focuses on reusing objects over and over again. It allows developers to easily call on components by name.

  Researched answer: OOP relies on classes and objects. Like I stated before, this programming model reduces ideas into reusable pieces of code which makes the overall workload a lot easier to grasp. Classes are 'blueprints' that can create different objects.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a decimal number. An integer is a whole number. 

  Researched answer: Floats in Ruby are officially categorized as 'imprecise decimal numbers'. Without getting too in depth, floats in Ruby are rounded off at the end, meaning that statements like '0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15' are evaluated as false. The actual answer includes a bunch of leading 0's before being rounded off. So technically, Ruby is correct. 

  Using integers to solved the a problem '2 / 10' will give you an answer of '0' in Ruby. But if you use a float instead, '2.0 / 10' is evaluated to '0.2'.

  Basically, floats and integers are two different classes in Ruby. That being said, they perform differently, depending on the use case.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means you don't have to specifically tell the program to return a value to you; the return is implied.

  Researched answer: Implicit return means that the last evaluated statement is returned UNLESS you explicitly tell Ruby to return elsewhere. Explicit return can be achieved by using the 'return' keyword. Keep in mind that explicit return can only be used within a method.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Used in OOP; a variable that is defined in a class which has a separate copy. So each instance of a class has variables that are only applied to itself, not the parent class.

2. PostgreSQL: Open Source SQL database; it is used to store data for web applications. It allows developers to safely scale their websites and applications 

3. Ruby on Rails: An open-source software (Rails) that, once combined with Ruby, allows developers to create websites; very popular among developers!

4. ORM: Object Relational Mapping; it calls data from a database automatically. Rails uses ActiveRecord

5. Active Record: Allows developers to easily work with their database, make changes, access data, and delete items.
